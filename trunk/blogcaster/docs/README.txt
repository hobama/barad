INTRODUCTION
------------
Blogcaster is a simple SWT based desktop application written in
Java, meant to be a fast simple way to throw stuff up onto your
Blog.  Right now it is a very early release (the simplest thing that
will work.)  But work it should on both windows 2000/XP/2003 
and Linux as long as you have a JRE installed.  If you don't
go to http://java.sun.com/ and get one.

INSTALLATION
------------
The heading is a little misleading, there is no real reason
to install anything, well except the JRE mentioned in the
introduction paragraph.  Just download the zip for your platform
and unzip it.  Don't worry there is a blogcaster dir inside 
the zip, I hate it when archives spew all over my download directory.
Then just execute the script included in the blogcaster directory.
A window should popup and let you put in the settings for your blog.

Feel free to move the blogcaster dir around to somewhere you want it
and make symbolic links/shortcuts to the script that starts it.

If you know what you are doing and know you have a funky java install
you may want to look at the script and tweak it.  It is pretty simple.

PROBLEMS
--------
Well, it is open source, solve em yourself ;).  Seriously though, feel
free to send us feedback, suggestions, patches.  You can send them to
the sourceforge hosted mailing list.  Or on the forums on there, we 
would like to improve this package.

PLANS
-----
We both use this software, so we have plans to improve it.  They can
surely be found on our blogs or on the http://blogcaster.sf.net/ site.

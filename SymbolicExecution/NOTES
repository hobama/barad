1. For each event listener create a set with widgets that it listens to.
	- Create a hash map of type <listener, set of widgets>
	- NOTE: 
	
2. How to detect the hierarchy of events?

3. Maybe I should add to each shell a field containing an event
   executor that will trigger all events for which there are listeners
   in the current shell. 
   
4. Problem: After execution of an event there is a state transition
   => How to backtrack!? Is it possible? Should I store the Heap and
   restore it after each event?!
   
5. How to handle the case of cascade windows?

6. How to trigger an event from the code?
	Just call the method of the event listener with appropriate parameters  
	
7. Maybe I should use reflection to invoke the methods (see bookmarked page)

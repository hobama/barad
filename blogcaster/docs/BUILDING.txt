To build a distributable package for your current OS, run ant package.
This will create a zip file build/blogcaster.zip that contains
- blogcaster.jar
- native
-- A bunch of objects needed for SWT on the target platform
-- blogcaster.{sh|cmd}

Just running "ant" or "ant build" will run build for the current platform, 
not doing the packaging, everything will live under build/blogcaster at that point.  
If you want to build for windows or linux run "ant win" or "ant linux".
